# INR-QSM
A subject-specific unsupervised deep learning approach for QSM (quantitative susceptibility mapping) reconstruction using implicit neural representation.
## The key features include:   
**(1)** The non-local phase effect is considered for the first time in the patch-based QSM deep learning method;  
**(2)** The proposed method is subject-specific and unsupervised, indicating that it is free of generalization problems and the requirement of a large dataset, which are two issues in the supervised deep learning methods;  
**(3)** The transfer learning strategy is adopted to accelerate the training process (3-fold acceleration per subject);  
**(4)** Suppression of noise, streaking artifacts, and over-smooth compared with traditional methods, robustness to input image contrast, voxel size, dipole kernel direction, and noise compared with other model-agnostic deep learning methods, robustness to input image contrast and voxel size compared with the model-based deep learning method.
