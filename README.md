# INR-QSM
subject-specific unsupervised deep learning for (quantitative susceptibility mapping) QSM reconstruction using implicit neural representation.
The key features include:   
(1) The non-local phase effect is considered for the first time in the patch-based QSM deep learning method;  
(2) The proposed method is subject-specific and unsupervised, indicating that it is free of generalization problems and the requirement of a large dataset;  
(3) The transfer learning strategy is adopted to accelerate the training process (~25 mins per subject);  
(4) Suppression of noise, streaking artifacts, and over-smooth compared with traditional methods, robustness to input image contrast, voxel size, dipole kernel direction, and noise compared with other model-agnostic deep learning methods, robustness to input image contrast and voxel size compared with the model-based deep learning method.
